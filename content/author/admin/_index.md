My main interest consists of neuronal modeling and data analysis, with use of Machine Learning inspired techniques.

Currently pursuing a Master of Science in Neuroengineering at Technical University of Munich. Research assistant at [Prof. Herz lab for Computational Neuroscience](http://www.neuro.bio.lmu.de/members/comp_neuro_herz/herz_a/index.html), working on data inference in single cell model.

During my Master I also contributed to the [ratCAVE](https://github.com/ratcave) project of Prof. Sirota lab at LMU.

Previously a [Technical Student](http://mad.web.cern.ch/mad/) at CERN.
